# MSP_HW2_VBA Code for Analyzing the Stock Market data




### what this code does:

This script will loop through for all the stock market data for a year, create four different columns:

* the Ticker symbols

* the Total stock volume for a year for each ticker

* yearly change for each ticker (the diff between the closing price on the last day of the year and the opening prince on the first day of the year) with conditional formatting   for positive and negative changes

* the percent change for that yearly price for each ticker

the script then will create these columns for each worksheet of the Excel file. 

Finally, for data for each year it will find the minimum, maximum and the highest total volume stock and print them along with their associated ticker symbol

there are three screenshots for the analyzed stock market data in 2014, 2015 and 21016 to this repo.
